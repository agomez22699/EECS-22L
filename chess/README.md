#--------------------------------- General Purpose ---------------------------------------------------------#

#The goal of this program is to learn chess. The goal of chess is to capture the other
# player's king. This capture is never actually completed, but once a king is under 
#attack and unable to avoid capture, it is said to be checkmated and the game is over. 
#The program will allow itâ€™s user to play chess on a virtual chessboard either against 
#a computer or against another user locally.
